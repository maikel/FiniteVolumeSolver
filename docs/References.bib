abstract = "The Shockless Explosion Combustion (SEC) is a novel approach to approximating constant volume combustion in gas turbines. It promises an efficiency gain comparable to that of pulse detonation combustion without the drawbacks associated with detonations. It utilizes quasi-homogeneous combustion of a volume of fuel & air mixture to avoid strong shock waves, similar to the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) process in internal combustion engines. Recharging is handled in analogy to a pulse jet combustor through resonant pressure waves in the combustion chamber. To achieve nearly homogeneous auto-ignition, a stratified layer of fuel/air is set up such that almost constant time to ignition remains across the charge once the recharging process is completed. Here we introduce simplified chemical kinetics models that enable efficient computational modeling of the entire process. Based on numerical simulations we assess essential influences of chemical kinetics on the subtle gasdynamics involved in the SEC process and discuss results on its feasibility."

  abstract    = {Block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) provides the basis for the temporal and spatial discretization strategy for a number of ECP applications in the areas of accelerator design, additive manufacturing, astrophysics, combustion, cosmology, multiphase flow, and wind plant modelling. AMReX is a software framework that provides a unified infrastructure with the functionality needed for these and other AMR applications to be able to effectively and efficiently utilize machines from laptops to exascale architectures. AMR reduces the computational cost and memory footprint compared to a uniform mesh while preserving accurate descriptions of different physical processes in complex multi-physics algorithms. AMReX supports algorithms that solve systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) in simple or complex geometries, and those that use particles and/or particle-mesh operations to represent component physical processes. In this paper, we will discuss the core elements of the AMReX framework such as data containers and iterators as well as several specialized operations to meet the needs of the application projects. In addition we will highlight the strategy that the AMReX team is pursuing to achieve highly performant code across a range of accelerator-based architectures for a variety of different applications.},
